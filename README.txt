To run and test this project, connect to the TMU VPN if you are off campus. Once VPN is connected, open a web browser and go to https://webdev.scs.ryerson.ca/~a4ishfaq/index2.php.

On the page, you can create, drop, and populate the database tables, as well as view, update, delete, and search records using the provided forms and menu. All error handling and feedback are built in, if a table does not exist or an operation fails, you’ll see a clear message telling you what happened.

Start by clicking "Create Tables" and "Populate Tables" before using the table features.
